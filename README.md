# Reaktor app for job application
Web application for fetching all product and availability data for a clothing brand.
The application is the coding exercise for Reaktor's job application.
If the application has just been started it may take a couple of minutes for it to load all of the data.
In this case it only shows an empty table.
The page must always be refreshed to see the newest fetched data from the API.
Otherwise, it should be fast to switch between pages.
